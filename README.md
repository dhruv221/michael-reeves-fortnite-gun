# Michael Reeves Fortnite Gun âš¡
This Project is a recreation of the one made by [Michael Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D75ZuaSR8nQ) which I made just for fun. 

This program is compatible with arduino. Feel free to use or modify it.

- The `main.py` is the file doing the image-to-text conversion and sending the commands to arduino.
- `usb_signal_detect.ino` is the Arduino program listening for the command sent by the python file which then activates the pin 9 for 3 seconds and turns it off again.
